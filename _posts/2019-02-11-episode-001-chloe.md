Chloe Anagnos, Publications Manager at The American Institute for Economic Research reveals that it was a trip to the tanning salon that nudged her towards libertarianism.  We talked about her Greek Orthodox upbringing and her commitment to ending the opioid epidemic - and the so-called war on drugs.  Chloe shared the personal and situational approach she takes to connect to young women on libertarian ideals.  Chloe also announced her plans to publish a book in the near future.
