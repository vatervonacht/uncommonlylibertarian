We have an open and delightful conversation with clinical psychologist, Dr. Michael Edelstein.  We discussed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and contrasted it with more mainstream approaches.   Dr. Edelstein talks about the impact of special interests on the practice of clinical psychology and how conversations with his fellow (non-libertarian) psychologists go. We also talk about two major influences in his life - Albert Ellis and Walter Block.
